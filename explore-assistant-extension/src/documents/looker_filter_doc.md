Simplified Looker Filter ExpressionsLooker filter expressions are an advanced way to refine queries. Always match the expression type to the field type (string, date/time, boolean, number). Only apply filters when necessary.String FiltersUsed for text-based fields. Case sensitivity depends on your Looker model's settings.ExampleDescriptionFOOIs equal to "FOO", exactly.FOO,BARIs equal to "FOO" or "BAR", exactly.%FOO%Contains "FOO".FOO%Starts with "FOO".%FOOEnds with "FOO".-FOOIs not equal to "FOO".-FOO%Doesn't start with "FOO".EMPTYString is empty (zero characters) or null.NULLValue is null.Date and Time FiltersUsed for date fields (e.g., date_date, date_time). Looker supports natural language.Relative Dates: Update dynamically based on the current date.today, yesterday, tomorrowthis {interval} (e.g., this month, this week, this year){n} {interval} (e.g., 3 days, 6 months) - Includes the current partial period.{n} {interval} ago (e.g., 3 days ago) - Refers to the specific past point in time (e.g., the day 3 days prior).last {n} {interval} (e.g., last 3 days) - Common for rolling ranges (e.g., today and the previous 2 days).next {week, month, quarter, year}Absolute Dates: Use specific dates for fixed ranges.YYYY/MM/DD (e.g., 2025/06/17)YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS (e.g., 2025/06/17 10:00:00)after {time}, before {time}{time} to {time} (e.g., 2025-06-01 to 2025-06-07){time} for {n} {interval} (e.g., 2025-06-01 for 7 days)Combining Date Filters:OR logic: Separate conditions with commas in a single filter (e.g., today, 7 days ago).AND logic: Use multiple date filters (e.g., one filter for after 2024-01-01 and another for before 3 months ago).Boolean FiltersUsed for yesno or boolean field types.yes or Yes / TRUE: Field evaluates to true.Note for Looker developers: Use lowercase for type: yesno dimensions; uppercase for filter parameters (e.g., in measures or always_filter).no or No / FALSE: Field evaluates to false.Note for Looker developers: Use lowercase for type: yesno dimensions; uppercase for filter parameters.Number FiltersSupport natural language, relational operators, and interval notation.ExampleDescription5Is exactly 5.NOT 5, <>5, !=5Is any value but 5.1, 3, 5Is one of these values exactly.>10, <10Greater than 10, Less than 10.>=5.5 AND <=10Between 5.5 and 10, inclusive.3 to 10Is 3 or greater but also 10 or less.NULLHas no data.NOT NULLHas some data.(1, 7)Greater than 1 and less than 7 (endpoints excluded).[5, 90]Greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 90 (endpoints included).(500, inf) or (500,)Greater than 500.(-inf, 10] or (,10]Less than or equal to 10.NOT (3,12)Less than or equal to 3 or greater than or equal to 12.
